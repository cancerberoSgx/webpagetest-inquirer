#TODO - Ideas

These are the ideas or TODOs that I thought and probably didn't accomplished yet, versioned in time:

#0.0.1

 * make a test-admin page that let modify the test definitions (and data) using jsoneditor
 * generate a testData/.metadata with meta info about all the test definitions.
 * while the test has started, intercept interrup signal (ctrl-c) and send a test cancel request
 * in the single test report do std deviation barchart expandable
 * be able to extract the data from the repeat-view
 * non random colors
 * let the user choose first view only or first and repeat view.

#0.0.2

 * verify wpt data - if a sample doesn't contain the necessary data (like a runs or videoFrames array) warn the user and let it abort or proceed. 
 * implement a non interactive mode in which the tool will always finish without interaction, if an error occurs the exist status !=0 and error log in a file...
 * a tool for downloading the images of video frames to fs so we can persists them permanently.





 #Dones

 * make a / /home that list / let choose from all test definitions detected - this was partially done but the home page needs better UX
